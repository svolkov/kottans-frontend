# kottans-frontend
**1. Finish the course “How to use Git and Github”**
- Working with GitHub.com I've found some new operations: forking, merging of the remote repositories. 
- I surprised that collaborating with other people via GitHub.com is not very hard.
- At least I’ll use my repositories on the GitHub.com to get the last version of my working data in the PC in the office and in the laptop at home.

**2. Watch try.github.io.**
- Git command “git log” was new for me.
- Format of the commit number surprised me.
- “-u” attribute of “git commit” will be used by me very often I think.

**3. Create repository named "kottans-frontend"**
- Repository named "kottans-frontend" has been created.
